 Fridg is a web application that strives to help reduce food waste by using Spoonacular's API to provide recipes maximizing ingredients on hand. Fridg also provides a checklist of missing ingredients which users may send as a shopping list to their phone via the Twilio API. Users may also save recipes and document their experiences to reference back to, such as if they've tried the recipe, give a 5-star rating, and add comments. Fridg is a full-stack, single page web app, built using React, Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. Our ingredients are one big happy family in the fridge. And family means no ingredient left behind or forgotten.

 ## About Me
 Hi and welcome! Michelle worked in a cancer precision medicine lab performing experiments on tissue specimens and analyzing drug responses. Michelle came to realize the true scientific method was utterly inefficient, left little room for creative problem solving, and didn't see herself growing in the field. She was extremely drawn to the efficiency and flexibility of problem solving, debugging, and testing along each step of coding. Turns out, coding is the scientific method on steroids! Software engineering and programming came naturally to her and she knew it was a perfect fit after every coding challenge she found herself more motivated and wanting to work harder. Software engineering provides many opportunities for growth and for Michelle to explore her creative problem-solving side!
